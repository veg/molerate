# Data for the MoleRate method

URL for the publication to be provided when available

| File  | Description | Credit |
|---|---|---|
|`ucsc-msa`| Mammalian gene alignments based on UCSD data. NEXUS alignments (one per gene). Offical gene names if available. `.gz` compressed | [Partha et al] (https://elifesciences.org/articles/25884) | 
|`ucsc.nwk`| The reference species tree with branch lengths for UCSC data| Nathan Clark  | 
|`species-lists` | Line lists of species with a particular phenotype | Maria Chikina |
|`simulations`| Simulated sequence data. 100 replicates per setting. Each directory is named as follows:  `labeling_stategy/LENGTH_N_RATE_R.tar.gz`, where `N` is the alignment length and `R` is the relative rate on test vs background (=1)| N/A  | 
|`simulation.nwk`| The reference tree used for sequence simulations | [Osipova et al] (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.30.610474v1)  | 
|`processor.py` | A Python script to generate a CSV file from a directory of MoleRate results | N/A |
|`results` | `MoleRate` results for the three phenotypes (+random) analyzed in the paper; each directory contains `.gzipped` JSON files | N/A| 
|`summaries` | `.csv` summaries by phenotype (generated by `processor.py`) | N/A|
